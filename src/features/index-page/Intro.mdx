  ðŸ‘‹ Hello there.
</a>

I'm&nbsp;Piotr&nbsp;Monwid&#8209Olechnowicz, and I'm so angry and scared.

However, this website is supposed to be a safe space, a garden of sorts,
so&nbsp;I&nbsp;won't rant about politics. Let's focus on programming.

I currently specialize in React and TypeScript. I maintain to
[Theme UI](https://github.com/hasparus/theme-ui) and contribute here and
there to other libraries. I build software at
[Flick](https://www.flick.tech/), and&nbsp;I'm one of [WrocÅ‚aw
TypeScript][wroc-ts] nerds.

This is my space on the internet, where I&nbsp;[write blog posts],
[collect&nbsp;things] that influenced me, and comment on them.
I&nbsp;try&nbsp;to&nbsp;learn in public.

Check out [my notes](/notes) â€” I started publishing little bits of my Foam
workspace recently, and the graph overview is pretty rad.
