### Hidden example

Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet.

```tsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { graphql, Link, useStaticQuery } from "gatsby";
import { Styled as s, jsx } from "theme-ui";

import { BlogPostsQuery } from "./__generated__/BlogPostsQuery";
import { Header, Root, theme } from "../components";
import { BlogpostDetails } from "../components/BlogpostDetails";
import { Seo } from "../components/Seo";

const IndexPage = () => {
  const { allMdx } = useStaticQuery<BlogPostsQuery>(graphql`
    query BlogPostsQuery {
      allMdx {
        nodes {
          frontmatter {
            title
            spoiler
            date
          }
          fields {
            route
            readingTime
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `);

  return (
    <Root>
      <Seo titleTemplate="%s" />
      <Header />
      <s.h1 sx={{ mt: 3, mb: 4 }}>haspar.us</s.h1>
      <s.p>
        Howdy! I'm Piotr Monwid-Olechnowicz and this is my personal blog.
      </s.p>
      <main>
        {allMdx.nodes.map((node, i) => {
          const { frontmatter, fields } = node!;
          const { title, spoiler, date } = frontmatter || {};

          return (
            <article key={i}>
              <header>
                <s.h3 sx={{ marginBottom: "0.4375rem", color: "text" }}>
                  <Link
                    to={fields!.route!}
                    sx={{
                      ...theme.styles.a,
                      color: "currentColor",
                    }}
                  >
                    {title}
                  </Link>
                </s.h3>
                <BlogpostDetails date={date} timeToRead={fields!.readingTime} />
              </header>
              <s.p>{spoiler}</s.p>
            </article>
          );
        })}
      </main>
    </Root>
  );
};

export default IndexPage;

## How can I use them? What will I gain?

I've refined the **_number_** into **_Even_** during my
[Wrocław TypeScript talk](https://github.com/hasparus/refinement-types-in-typescript).\
Having a type for even numbers doesn't sound really useful but the idea stays the
same for real world types with complex names copied from Jira.

_We can call the predicate once and if it's true, we remember this fact in the
type system to avoid accidental errors._

### Example time

#### Almost real example

Assume we're building a form in which users can enter a list of emails into a
textarea to send activation links to give their friends write permissions for
the app (let's say it's a CMS).

We validate these emails once, and if they're all valid, we save them, and
later, few steps further in the form, we send our activation links. Few days
later, we get a new requirement -- the user should be able to edit the data at
the last step of the form. Cool, the form is pretty long, we understand that it
can be useful. Several lines of code and we're done. We go home happy about the
good code we pushed. Next morning we see a new issue in the tracker --
_"Validate emails after the user does final edits"_ -- We totally forgot about
the validation.

#### How could we save the day with a refinement type?

- Create a subtype of **_string_** called **_ValidEmail_**, such that
  **_string_** is not assignable to **_ValidEmail_**.
- Hold already validated emails in a list of type **_ValidEmails_**.
- Now you can't push a string to a list of already validated emails ✨
- Change the type of `sendEmail` function from `(email: string) => void*` to
  `(email: ValidEmail) => void`. \
  It doesn't make sense to send an email to `"🦄🐵💣"` which is a perfectly valid
  string.

( \* ) or IO, Result, choose your favorite.

#### Yeah right, but how can I create this "ValidEmail" type?

However you want! It's just an idea from type theory and you can implement it in
your favorite way. Few ideas:

- you can go full OOP and extend a **_String_**,
- use [nominal](https://github.com/hasparus/nom-ts)&nbsp;
  [typing](https://michalzalecki.com/nominal-typing-in-typescript/#approach-4-intersection-types-and-brands)
  and leave no runtime trail _(my favorite option)_,
- put the string into a
  [value object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object), because
  **_ValidEmail_** doesn't even have to be a subtype of **_string_**. \
  The key is that **_string_** is not assignable to **_ValidEmail_**, because we
  want to ensure validation.

### User defined type guards

We can use TypeScript’s
[user defined type guards](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#using-type-predicates)
to tell the compiler that our predicate checks the type and this is exactly what
we’re interested in when we talk about refinements.

Let’s empower our `isValidEmail` predicate by changing its signature from
`(s: string) => boolean` to `(s: string) => s is ValidEmail`.

## Takeaways

- Refinements are not implemented in TypeScript, but you can make them in
  userspace.
- You can use nominal typing to make sure your refinements have no runtime trail
  (except predicate checks).
- You can use them to encode facts about your data in the type system.

## Further reading

_This is mostly a reading list for future me, but I hope you can also find it
interesting._

- [refined](https://github.com/fthomas/refined) for Scala sounds really
  interesting and with [ScalaJs](https://www.scala-js.org/) I could target the
  same platforms as TypeScript.
