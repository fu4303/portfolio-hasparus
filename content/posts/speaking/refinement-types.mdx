### Pitch

I’m gonna explain what refinement types are, geek out about a research
paper that adds them to the TypeScript type system, and live-code a
userland refinement type you can already use in your codebase.

### What, Why, and How

#### How?

Lightning talk with VSCode, Quokka and browser as software.

#### What?

Refinement types are easy.
Use them to encode more info on the type level.

#### Why?

Encoding information on the type level helps you write less bugs.

### Outline

- Why and when should I type stronger?
  - JS without JSDoc vs Idris proofs
  - Refinement types are one step further into bulletproof programs.
- Refined TypeScript
- It’s not rocket science
- You can do it yourself
  - Live demo
- Libraries with refinements
