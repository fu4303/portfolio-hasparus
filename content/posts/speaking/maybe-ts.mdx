I spoke about problems with hard Option type (like the one from fp-ts)
mentioned in Rich Hickey's ["Maybe Not"][maybe not] and presented a foldable traversable
monad instance which can used instead of Option to avoid the
problems mentioned by Rich.

**Edit: It breaks composition law :(**

Thanks to [@oliverjash] and the [FP Slack] I learned and [@gcanti]
released the version 0.2.1 of fp-ts-laws ðŸ˜….

A functor is a mapping between categories.
gcanti's [post on dev.to] excellently explains what a category is.

An endofunctor is a functor which maps a category into itself ðŸ”„

An endofunctor in TypeScript is a type `F<A>` with a `map` function of type `<A, B>(fa: F<A>, f: (a: A) => B) => F<B>`.

We're pretty used to how `map` works for the most popular functor, the Array.
It would be cool if the definition of Functor was limited to the types where `map`
behaves similarly. It is. These are the [laws]:

[laws]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor#Definition

```
1. functors preserve identity:
   F.map(fa, a => a) = fa
2. functors preserve composition:
   F.map(fa, a => bc(ab(a))) = F.map(F.map(fa, ab), bc)
```

Our type is defined as

```ts
type Maybe<T> = T | null | undefined;
```

Since `Maybe<Maybe<T>>` collapses to `Maybe<T>`,
we do not preserve composition. It is not a functor over nullables.
Similar scenario takes place for `Promise` and thenables.

#### Counterexample

```ts
const f = (x: string | null) => (x ? x.length : 0);
const g = (y: number) => (y === 10 ? null : String(y * 2));

const left = map(10, x => f(g(x)));
const right = map(map(10, g), f);

console.log(left, right); // 0 null
```

#### Can we save it?

But hey! I don't really need `Maybe<null | undefined>`. It's useless.
What if we could just get rid of these two empty values?

Let's constrain the generic parameter. We'll have to say goodbye to the fp-ts HKT,
but let's just try for educational purposes.

```ts
export type Nothing = null | undefined;

type NotNothing =
  | string
  | number
  | boolean
  | bigint
  | symbol
  | Function
  | Date
  | Error
  | RegExp;

export type Maybe<T extends NotNothing> = T | Nothing;
```

Let's just paste `extends NotNothing` into every function that's now glowing red.

import imgSrc from "../../assets/maybe-ts__ha.png";

<img
  src={imgSrc}
  alt="A type error that defends us from the counterexample."
/>

Our `Maybe` is not an endofunctor in TypeScript, but it is a mapping between _non-nullable TypeScript_ to TypeScript!
Yeah! It is a functor then! **Just not an useful one.**

### Outline

- who am I
- wtf is Option
- problems with Option in fp-ts
  - small problems
    - fp-ts.Option.None is truthy
    - incompatible with TS syntactic sugar
      optional chaining `(.?)` and nullish coalescing `(??)`
  - big problems (mentioned in Maybe Not)
    - relaxing a requirement should be a compatible change
    - strengthening a promise should be a compatible change
- a simple solution
  ```ts
  type Maybe<T> = T | null | undefined;
  ```
- implementing a fp-ts typeclass instance to use instead of Option
  - rad [codesurfer](https://github.com/pomber/code-surfer) [slides](https://maybe-ts.now.sh/10)
- problems solved
  - âœ” relaxing a requirement is a compatible change
  - âœ” strengthening a promise is a compatible change
  - âœ” it just worksâ„¢ with optional chaining and nullish coalescing operators
  - âœ” Nothing is properly empty value `(Nothing == null) === true`
- when would you prefer Option?
  - strictNullChecks: false
  - `null` (or `undefined`) is an important part of T
