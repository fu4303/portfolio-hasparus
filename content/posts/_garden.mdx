âš  _unfinished post_

This is a README of this website, describing the interesting bits of the
tech stack, the motivation behind it, and the goals of it.

I encountered swyx's
[Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) and realized
I'm doing something wrong. I was doing a heckload of notes. It was before I
found out about [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), so my notes were a
chaotic mess of random Notion pages, Dropbox Paper docs and sheets I took
out of the printer to cover with illegible hieroglyphs. One future awaited
all of them. Forgotten and lost. Thrown away with the rubbish.

"Maybe I can make them helpful for somebody else," I thought. Spellcheck
them in Grammarly. Write a bunch of MDX files. Publish them with Gatsby.

I started a blog. Turns out, blogging is hard for me. Polishing one piece of
notes to "blog post quality" took a few days of writing and two weeks of
minor fixes. I tried hard because I heard a lot about building a personal
brand. Somebody asked how many impressions I make and where do they come
from. What? I didn't set up analytics. I don't want to!

I want to publish the good parts of my notes and link to cool stuff I find
on the internet. I want to have a personal website, like my former
[lecturers] at the uni. A bit ugly. Practical and fun in a little weird way.

[lecturers]: http://www.ii.uni.wroc.pl/~wzychla/

Take a look at swyx.io. It has a big heading saying "SWYX'S SITE!". The
about page is empty. These gradient link hovers aren't pretty, but they put
a big smile on my face. It's awesome.

I'm gonna go this way. I want to stop spending half of my free evenings on
this website and have fun with it.

Turns out I'm not the only one.

Here are the articles that clarified the idea for me and inspired me in the
order I read them.

- [Joel Hooks's Digital Garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)
- [Tom Critchlow's Building a digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/)

- [Joel Hooks' On Writing More](https://joelhooks.com/on-writing-more)
- [Brendan Schlagels's Canonize: Creating a Personal Canon Template](https://www.brendanschlagel.com/2017/11/05/canonize-creating-personal-canon-template/)
- [github.com/johno/digital-garden readme.md](https://github.com/johno/digital-garden/blob/afe6e622fac33b33225b27071f627eb9475a6ed3/readme.md)

My goal isn't to reach many and build my brand through a stream of targeted
blog posts. I want to just enjoy having this garden. This is what gardens
are about, right? Both pleasant and useful for their owner.
I'm&nbsp;tweaking it a bit here and there, and writing posts occasionally.

I have encountered a few exciting problems while building it, and I'd love
to write more about them and the solutions for them that I have implemented.
I believe this website to be a good example of what is possible in a limited
time with the sheer power of Gatsby. The two most interesting things I did:

- Rendering social card images with React
- Collecting post commits to display a history of edits in a blog post

I may turn them into standalone blog posts one day, but let me focus on the
latter one here.

### A Blog Post Git History

The publishing dates of posts are pretty problematic. I update my posts
sometimes. Should I change the date then?

Kent C. Dodds asked why doesn't he have dates on his blog posts [said] he
just keeps all of them up to date. Publish dates would be confusing. I get
that point, but I kind of want to keep the dates, at least for myself as a
_created_at_ information.

[said]: https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1205885556091015168

I firmly believe that knowing the road is more valuable than knowing only
the destination.

Instead of showing fewer dates, I decided to show more. I keep my posts in a
git repository, so I have a fairly good idea of what and when was changed.

Using [createSchemaCustomization], I added a `history` field to posts
frontmatter. This is nullable, so not all posts have history displayed and
for those which do, I'd like to decide whether we show full commits or just
a number of edits and a time span. You can find the `Verbose` variant in my
[reading list](/reading) and the `DatesOnly` variant here, right below this
post.

[createschemacustomization]:
  https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/schema-customization/

<style>{`.vscode-highlight-line .mtk5.mtk5 { color: unset; }`}</style>

```graphql
type Mdx implements Node {
  frontmatter: MdxFrontmatter
}

enum BlogpostHistoryType {
  Verbose
  DatesOnly
}

type MdxFrontmatter @dontInfer {
  title: String!
  spoiler: String!
  date: Date!
  history: BlogpostHistoryType
}
```

Based on a code I copied from a gist, I have formatted the git log in a
parseable way. ([see the code])

[see the code]:
  https://github.com/hasparus/homepage/blob/dcb621790da3e062d006d0c21a2c428ac99392fb/scripts/getGitLogJsonForFile.ts

Then, I have added the corresponding property to MDXFields.

```graphql
type Mdx implements Node {
  frontmatter: MdxFrontmatter
  fields: MdxFields
}

type BlogpostHistoryEntry {
  abbreviatedCommit: String
  authorDate: Date!
  subject: String
  body: String
}

type BlogpostHistory {
  entries: [BlogpostHistoryEntry!]!
  url: String!
}

type MdxFields {
  route: String!
  history: BlogpostHistory
}
```

Connected it all together with about 50 lines of code and a one function
call in onCreateNode in `gatsby-node-ts.ts`.

```ts
export const onCreateNode: GatsbyNode["onCreateNode"] = async (args) => {
  const { node, getNode } = args;

  if (node.internal.type === "Mdx") {
    const mdxNode = (node as unknown) as generated.Mdx;

    const route = toLower(createFilePath({ node, getNode }));

    createBlogpostHistoryNodeField(args, route);
  }
};
```

You can find the code of the function
[here](https://github.com/hasparus/homepage/blob/4f4025aaabf8053dde3155c571f80594f9c96799/gatsby-node-ts.ts#L233-L287).
Adding the [UI] to the post layout was fairly straightforward.

_to be continued_
