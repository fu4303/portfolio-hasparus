I did a lunch&learn on Dark today at my office, because I was desperate to share.
I live-coded for about 20 minutes and we watched [Ellen's demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgimI2SnpTQ).
Folks at Chop-Chop agree that Dark is freakin awesome.

So many brilliant ideas. My favorite is probably the structured editor.

> Code in Dark is written in the Dark editor. The structured editor doesn’t allow you to make syntax errors. In fact, Dark doesn’t even have a parser. As you type, we manipulate the AST directly, similar to Paredit, Sketch-n-Sketch, Tofu, Prune, Lamdu, and MPS.
>
> Every state of incomplete code in Dark has a valid execution semantics, similar to typed holes in Hazel. For example, as you change a function call, we maintain the memory of the old function until the new one is valid.
>
> Since every program in Dark has meaning, incomplete code doesn’t prevent complete code from working.
