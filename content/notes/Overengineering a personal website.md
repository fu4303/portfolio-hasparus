I used Gatsby (React and GraphQL included), MDX and TypeScript. You
certainly don't need these technologies to build a website. It would be a
really bad idea for simple websites.

Thing is, I already knew that tech stack, it allows me to do some absurd
things, like collecting bidirectional wikilinks inside my notes, and
rendering them as an interactive graph; showing git history under my
articles, etc.

And I enjoyed it. Would I recommend Gatsby and TypeScript for a travel blog?
Probably not. It's a great choice for something as big as [TypeScript
Website][ts-website].
