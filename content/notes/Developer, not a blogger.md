I strongly disagree with the idea that it's somehow "unproductive" to work
on your blog for a week and publish only one blog post after.

I'm not a blogger. I'm a developer. I wanted to build a blog, and I have
one. That's all. Do I need to write something more? No. It might be "good
for my career", but I didn't promise anybody to write blog posts.

And you know what's also totally okay? [[Overengineering a personal
website]].
