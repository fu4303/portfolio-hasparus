# Friday 4th of December 2020

It's Friday, December 4 of the longest year. It's 43 days after Polish
~~Constitutional~~ Court ruled to make almost all cases of abortion illegal
and sparked the Women's Strike, the biggest wave of protests in Poland since
the revolution of 1989 and the end of Polish People's Republic.

It's also my 2nd engagement anniversary, and the day when I finally found
some time for Advent of Code.

My goal for the challenge is to learn something new. I'm highly interested
in unconventional approaches to programming, structured editors, and
bundling of concerns.

I'll use this year's Advent of Code to learn some new stuff.

You can see a my solutions in [[advent-of-code-2020]] note.
